The repository contains two implementations: one using SageMath as well as an independent one in Haskell. [Uniform random generator for \u03b2-normal closed linear terms] Allows for the sampling of closed linear lambda-terms with no \u03b2-redices, i.e. closed linear normal forms. Closed linear normal forms correspond to theorems in implicative linear logic. [Zero tester for differential polynomials involving differentially-algebraic power series] A quick-and-dirty implementation (in Maple, using the DifferentialAlgebra package) of an algorithm that appears in the article \"Computing with D-algebraic power series\" of Joris van der Hoeven (Applicable Algebra in Engineering, Communication and Computing volume 30, 2019). Written mainly for personal use, it allows one to test whether a given expression involving differentially-algebraic power series is zero. [Qumin, a minimalist quantum programming language] Developed as part of my undergraduate thesis, Qumin and QImp consist of a toy programming language for quantum programming as well as an interpreter and a library of auxiliary functionalities. Qumin is equipped with a simple typing system based on a fragment of the linear lambda-calculus equipped with primitives suitable for quantum programming.","title":"Software"},{"location":"software/#software","text":"Below are some coding projects (all in desperate need of documentation) that I've worked on: [Uniform random generator of Schr\u00f6der trees] Developed in collaboration with Mehdi Naima , this sampler allows for the generation of random objects drawn from user-specified families of labelled trees with various restrictions (increasing labellings, with repetitions, etc).

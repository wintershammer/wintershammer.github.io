I am a doctoral student in the [CALIN](https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/accueil/equipe/calin/) team, at [LIPN](lipn.univ-paris13.fr/) in Universit√© Sorbonne Paris Nord. 

My thesis project, supervised by Olivier Bodini and Noam Zeilberger, is the asymptotic study of certain *divergent combinatorial classes* whose specifications are *differentially algebraic*.  I am interested in developing tools for tackling the asymptotic analysis of *divergent series* arising in combinatorics. Furthermore, I am interested in applying these tools to the study of asymptotic properties of fragments of the *linear lambda calculus* and their connection with various kinds of *trivalent maps*. 

More generally, I am interested in the interplay of *logic*, *combinatorics*, and *graph theory*.

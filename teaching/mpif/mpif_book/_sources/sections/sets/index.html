    <h1 id="naive-theory-of-sets">Naive theory of sets</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Set theory is the mathematical study of collections of objects.
A relatively new branch of mathematics, it was born in late 1873 
in the work of <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor">Georg Cantor</a> 
who was investigating the properties of the real numbers.</p>
<p>Despite the apparent simplicity of the basic objects it treats, sets and their 
elements, set theory is a rich and fundamental branch of modern mathematics.
Its birth was a watershed moment, playing a central role in the quest for a 
formal foundation of mathematics that took place late in the 19th century and early
20th centuries.
During this time, it became apparent that concepts such as infinite sets
were not properly handled by mathematicians: 
famous <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradoxe_de_Russell">paradoxes</a> had arisen that required immediate
resolution - lest mathematics is shown to be inconsistent! </p>
<p>The solution to this crisis was given by a <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9orie_des_ensembles_de_Zermelo-Fraenkel">formal theory of sets</a> introduced by Zermelo and Fraenkel, which finally
succeeded in formalising the notion of sets, thus giving mathematics a 
proper foundation. Since then, set theory has been an active subject of 
research for mathematicians, logicians, and philosophers.</p>
<p>In this course, our investigations will mostly concern finite sets. Therefore a
naive theory of sets (much simpler than the aforementioned theory of Zermelo
and Fraenkel) will suffice. This affords us the privilege of working in informal
language (instead of formal logic) and taking for granted various basic
notions. However we should always be aware of the following drawback of our
informal approach: our results will not always directly transfer from finite to
infinite sets. Infinity is as wonderful as it is unintuitive!</p>
<h2 id="mathematical-language">Mathematical language</h2>
<p>Before we proceed with our study of sets, let us first
fix some basic notions of the informal mathematical language we will develop during our study. </p>
<p>We start with the basic notions of <em>constants</em> and <em>connectives</em>.</p>
<p>Constants are symbols corresponding to named objects whose existence we assume to be given. 
Examples of such constants are:
* The <span class="arithmatex">\(\top\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(\bot\)</span> symbols which are read as "true" and "false" respectively,
* any other symbols such as <span class="arithmatex">\(\bullet, \circ, \triangle\)</span>.</p>
<p>Of course a language that can only refer to one individual object at a time
isn't very interesting. Connectives serve to glue together formulas to form
bigger ones. In the simplest case they can be either <em>unary</em> in which case they
modify a single formula or <em>binary</em> in which case they are used to glue
together two formulas. The basic ones we'll use are:
* <span class="arithmatex">\(\lnot\)</span> which is a unary connective read as "not". 
* <span class="arithmatex">\(\land\)</span> which is a binary connective read as "and".
* <span class="arithmatex">\(\lor\)</span>, which is a binary connective read as  "or".
* <span class="arithmatex">\(\rightarrow\)</span> which is a binary connective read as "implies".
Examples of use of such connectives are <span class="arithmatex">\(\not \triangle\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(true \land false\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(\bullet \implies true\)</span>.
For more complicated formulas, we may use parenthesis for disambiguating: <span class="arithmatex">\((\not true) \implies true\)</span>.</p>
<p>So far all we have done is define the <em>syntax</em> of our language: symbols with no intrinsic meaning and ways to combine
them to form bigger formulas. Assigning a meaning to them is the subject of <em>semantics</em> which we will treat in a very
informal manner: 
* To the symbols <span class="arithmatex">\(\top\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(\bot\)</span> we will assign the two classical <em>boolean</em> values of <span class="arithmatex">\(true\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(false\)</span>.
* To the symbols <span class="arithmatex">\(\bullet, \circ, \triangle\)</span> we can assign "abstract objects" which we assume already exist and whose
precise nature isn't relevant.</p>
<p>To the connectives we assign unary or binary <em>boolean functions</em>:
* To <span class="arithmatex">\(\lnot\)</span> we will assign the function which maps <span class="arithmatex">\(true\)</span> to <span class="arithmatex">\(false\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(false\)</span> to <span class="arithmatex">\(true\)</span>.
* To <span class="arithmatex">\(\land\)</span> we will assign the function which evaluates to <span class="arithmatex">\(true\)</span> if and only if both its
inputs are <span class="arithmatex">\(true\)</span>. That is, to <span class="arithmatex">\(P \land Q\)</span> we assign the value <span class="arithmatex">\(true\)</span> if and only if both <span class="arithmatex">\(P\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Q\)</span> both have the value <span class="arithmatex">\(true\)</span>.
* To <span class="arithmatex">\(\lor\)</span> we will assign the function which evaluates to <span class="arithmatex">\(true\)</span> if either of its inputs is <span class="arithmatex">\(true\)</span>. That is <span class="arithmatex">\(P \lor Q\)</span> is <span class="arithmatex">\(true\)</span>
if either <span class="arithmatex">\(P\)</span> or <span class="arithmatex">\(Q\)</span> are.
* To <span class="arithmatex">\(\rightarrow\)</span> we assign the function that evaluates to <span class="arithmatex">\(false\)</span> if and only if its first argument is <span class="arithmatex">\(true\)</span> and the second one is
<span class="arithmatex">\(false\)</span>, otherwise it evaluates to <span class="arithmatex">\(true\)</span>. That is <span class="arithmatex">\(P \rightarrow Q\)</span> is always <span class="arithmatex">\(true\)</span> except if <span class="arithmatex">\(P\)</span> is <span class="arithmatex">\(true\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Q\)</span> is <span class="arithmatex">\(false\)</span>, 
in which case the whole formula is <span class="arithmatex">\(false\)</span>.</p>
<p>We will further enrich this language with new concepts where this is useful. We will also
freely switch between this more abstract notation and its natural language equivalent, 
employing whichever allows us to most succintly and clearly state our desired formulas.</p>
<h2 id="sets-and-their-elements">Sets and their elements</h2>
<p>Finally we are ready to introduce our central objects of study.</p>
<p>(def-set)=
```{admonition} Definition (Set).
A set is an unordered collection of objects, called elements of the set.
These elements are understood to be all distinct (no repetitions allowed). 
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>While very informal from a modern mathematical perspective, this &quot;definition&quot; is quite close to the one Cantor himself gives in {cite:p}`cantor1895beitrage`:

```{epigraph}
A set is a gathering together into a whole of definite, distinct objects of our perception or of our thought—which are called elements of the set.

-- Georg Cantor
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>Having introduced a new mathematical object, let us now enrich our language
with new constants appropriate for talking about sets. First of all we
introduce the symbol <span class="arithmatex">\(\emptyset\)</span> which stands for the empty set: the set that
contains no element, which we assume to exist. 
We will also assume the existence of the <em>set of natural numbers</em> for which we introduce the
constants <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> for the set itself and the usual indo-arabic
numerals <span class="arithmatex">\(0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\)</span> for its elements. We may also admit some basic functions 
and relations on natural numbers such as <span class="arithmatex">\(+, -, *, /, \geq, \leq\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, we admit <em>extensional notation</em> which is a very common way to represent sets 
by listing its elements seperated by commas and put between braces <span class="arithmatex">\(\{, \}\)</span>. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A set containing the first 3 non-zero natural numbers may be written as: <span class="arithmatex">\(\{1, 2, 3\}\)</span>.</li>
<li>A set containing two abstract elements is <span class="arithmatex">\(\{\bullet, \circ \}\)</span>.</li>
<li>The empty set, which contains nothing, is written as <span class="arithmatex">\(\{\}\)</span> or <span class="arithmatex">\(\emptyset\)</span> for short.</li>
</ul>
<p>A set being an object in itself can therefore be an element of another set: <span class="arithmatex">\(\{1,2,\{1,5\}\}\)</span> is a perfectly valid set 
containing the elements <span class="arithmatex">\(1, 2, \{1, 5\}\)</span> [^1].</p>
<p>[^1]: Indeed, in formal set theory we often work at the level of abstraction where
all objects are either the empty set or a set of sets. Surprisingly, this suffices
to describe all known mathematical objets: numbers, functions, geometric objects, etc.</p>
<p>Two sets will be considered <em>the same</em> or <em>equal</em> if they have the same elements. As mentioned in the <a href="def-set">above definition</a>
the order the elements in the extensional representation of a set doesn't matter: the sets <span class="arithmatex">\(\{1,2,3\}, \{3,2,1\}, \{2,1,3\}\)</span> are
all equal. For this relation, we introduce the connective <span class="arithmatex">\(=\)</span> which is a function of two sets: <span class="arithmatex">\(A = B\)</span> is <span class="arithmatex">\(true\)</span> if <span class="arithmatex">\(A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(B\)</span>
are equal. </p>
<p>Another important notion is that of <em>membership</em> between an object and a set. We use the connective <span class="arithmatex">\(\in\)</span> to denote
this relation. For example, <span class="arithmatex">\(1 \in \{1, 2, 3\}\)</span> stands for the statement that the set <span class="arithmatex">\(\{1, 2, 3\}\)</span> contaons <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> (which is true!), 
while <span class="arithmatex">\(4 \in \{1, 2, 3\}\)</span> is the statement that the same set contains <span class="arithmatex">\(4\)</span> (which is false!). 
Finally, <span class="arithmatex">\(\not\in\)</span> stands for the relation of <em>non-membership</em>: <span class="arithmatex">\(4 \not\in \{1,2,3\}\)</span> is true.</p>
<h2 id="variables-and-quantifiers">Variables and quantifiers</h2>
<p>To facilitate the manipulation of sets and their objects, we enrich our
language by allowing the use of <em>variables</em>: these will be used as arguments to
set-theoretic functions. We will denote variables by lowercase latin letters
<span class="arithmatex">\(x, y, z, \dots\)</span> intented to stand for elements and uppercase ones such as <span class="arithmatex">\(A,
B, S, U \dots\)</span> intented to stand for sets. Variables themselves don't have much
use unless coupled with the use of <em>quantifiers</em>: the universal quantifier
<span class="arithmatex">\(\forall\)</span> and the existential quantifier <span class="arithmatex">\(\exists\)</span> which are read as "for all"
and "there exists". Quantifiers <em>bind</em> variables in a formula: both <span class="arithmatex">\(\forall\)</span>
and <span class="arithmatex">\(\exists\)</span> are accompanied by a variable and a formula. The basic syntax is
that of <span class="arithmatex">\(\forall x P\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(\exists x P\)</span>, where <span class="arithmatex">\(P\)</span> is a formula in which the
variable <span class="arithmatex">\(x\)</span> appears <em>free</em>, that is not bound by any quantifier.</p>
<p>In terms of semantics, variables will be given values in a set which contains all objects we're interested in.
This universal set is also called the <em>domain of discourse</em>. </p>
<p>The formula <span class="arithmatex">\(\forall x~P\)</span> will be given the value <span class="arithmatex">\(true\)</span> if and only if the formula <span class="arithmatex">\(P\)</span> is true for
any possible assignment of <span class="arithmatex">\(x\)</span>. 
The formula <span class="arithmatex">\(\exists x~P\)</span> will be given the value <span class="arithmatex">\(true\)</span> if and only if there exists at least one assignment of <span class="arithmatex">\(x\)</span> that makes
<span class="arithmatex">\(P\)</span> true.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>The formula <span class="arithmatex">\(\exists x~(x \in {1,2,3}) \land (x \in \{2,4,6\})\)</span> is true,</li>
<li>while <span class="arithmatex">\(\forall x ~ (x \in \{1,2,3\}) \rightarrow (x \in \{2,4,6\})\)</span> is false.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll often use the shorthand <span class="arithmatex">\(\exists x \in S~P\)</span> to stand for <span class="arithmatex">\(\exists x ~ (x \in S) \land P\)</span> 
and <span class="arithmatex">\(\forall x \in S~P\)</span> to stand for <span class="arithmatex">\(\forall x . (x \in S \rightarrow P)\)</span>. Letting <span class="arithmatex">\(A = \{1,2,3\}\)</span>
and <span class="arithmatex">\(B = \{2,4,6\}\)</span> we can use this shorthand notation to rewrite the above two examples as:
* <span class="arithmatex">\(\exists x \in A ~ x \in B\)</span> and
* <span class="arithmatex">\(\forall x \in A ~ x \in B\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="the-subset-relation">The subset relation</h2>
<p>Given the above, we may now define a relation between sets which captures the notion of a set being inside another.</p>
<p>(def-subset)=
```{admonition} Definition (Subset).
We say that a set <span class="arithmatex">\(A\)</span> is a subset of a set <span class="arithmatex">\(B\)</span>, denoted by <span class="arithmatex">\(A \subseteq B\)</span>,
if all elements of <span class="arithmatex">\(A\)</span> belong to <span class="arithmatex">\(B\)</span>. That is, <span class="arithmatex">\(A \subseteq B\)</span> if and only if <span class="arithmatex">\(\forall x \in A ~ x \in B\)</span>.
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>From this, two important facts follow:
* Any set is a subset of itself: $A \subseteq A$ is true.
* The empty set is a subset of any set: $\forall S~\emptyset \subseteq S$ is true.

As an example, $\{2,4,6\} \subseteq \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$, while $\{1,2,3\} \not\subseteq \{1,2,\{3,4,5\}\}$, where
$A \not\subseteq B$ stands for $\lnot(A \subseteq B)$.

A convenient way for describing subsets which complements the extensional notation introduced above is the intensional
way: we specify a set $A$ as a subset of some set $B$ whose elements satisfy an additional property. For example:
$\{ x \in \{1,2,3\} \lvert x &gt;= 2\}$ defines the set $\{2,3\}$.

(section-operations)=
## Operations on sets

Apart from the extensional and intensional ways of constructing sets, we may construct new sets by combining old ones
via a number of operations:

(def-union)=
```{admonition} Definition (Union).
The union of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \cup B$, is the set consisting of all
elements of $A$ and all those of $B$.
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>(def-intersection)=
```{admonition} Definition (Intersection).
The intersection of two sets <span class="arithmatex">\(A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(B\)</span>, denoted by <span class="arithmatex">\(A \cap B\)</span>, is the set consisting of all
elements of <span class="arithmatex">\(A\)</span> that also belong to <span class="arithmatex">\(B\)</span>.
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>(def-difference)=
```{admonition} Definition (Difference).
The difference of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \setminus B$, is the set consisting of all
elements of $A$ that do not belong to $B$.
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>(def-complement)
```{admonition} Definition (Complement).
The complement of a set <span class="arithmatex">\(A\)</span> with respect to the domain of
discourse <span class="arithmatex">\(U\)</span> is <span class="arithmatex">\(U \setminus A\)</span>.
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>(def-props)=
Some important identities involving these operations are:

* $A \cap B = B \cap A$
* $A \cup B = B \cup A$
* $A \cap (B \cap C) = (A \cap B) \cap C$
* $A \cup (B \cup C) = (A \cup B) \cup C$
* $A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$
* $E \setminus (E \setminus A) = A$
* $E \setminus (A \cup B) = (E \setminus A) \cap (E \setminus B)$
* $E \setminus (A \cap B) = (E \setminus A) \cup (E \setminus B)$

An easy way to convince ourselves that these properties hold is to
draw *Venn diagrams*, in which the universe of discourse is drawn
as a box and its subsets are drawn as &quot;ovaloid&quot; shapes such that the shapes corresponding to two sets $A,B$ are overlapping if $A \cap B \neq \emptyset$ and non-overlapping otherwise.

For example, for three sets $A,B,C$ with $A \cap B \neq \emptyset, (A \cup B) \cap C \neq \emptyset$ we draw the following:

## Cardinality

An important notion for sets is that of *cardinality*: 
(def-cardinality)=
```{admonition} Definition (Cardinality)
The cardinality of a finite set is its number of elements.
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>We often use the notation <span class="arithmatex">\(\lvert A \rvert\)</span> to denote the cardinality of a set <span class="arithmatex">\(A\)</span>.
For example the set <span class="arithmatex">\(\{1,2,3\}\)</span> is of cardinality <span class="arithmatex">\(\lvert\{1,2,3\}\rvert = 3\)</span> while
<span class="arithmatex">\(\lvert\{1,2,\{1,5\},\emptyset,\{2,3,\{4\}\}\}\rvert = 5\)</span>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>A word of caution is in order: the above definition is very, very informal and quite circular.
The formal definition of cardinality used in contemporary mathematics 
is actually founded on the notion of *bijections*, which handles in a uniform manner the
case of finite and infinite sets.
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="tuples-and-cartesian-products">Tuples and Cartesian products</h2>
<p>Let us now introduce yet another notion of a collection of elements.</p>
<p>(def-tuple)=
```{admonition} Definition (<span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span>-tuple)
Given a natural number <span class="arithmatex">\(n \in \mathbb{N}\)</span>, an <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span>-tuple is an ordered 
collection of <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span> elements.
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Unlike sets, $n$-tuples therefore care about the order elements are listed in 
and allow repetitions as well.

We will denote $n$-tuples using a syntax similar to that of sets, replacing the braces $\{,\}$ by
parenthesis $\(,\)$. To $n$-tuples will be considered *equal* if they contain the same elements in the same order.
Examples of some $n$-tuples are:
* $(1,2)$, a $2$-tuple also called a *pair*.
* $(2,1)$, another $2$-tuple different from the above.
* $(1,2,3,4,5)$, $(1,8,10,3,0)$, two $5$-tuples.

The following construction allows us to construct $n$-tuples from sets.

(def-cartesianprod)=
```{admonition} Definition ($n$-fold Cartesian product)
Given a natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $n$ sets $S_1, S_2, \dots, S_n$,
the $n$-fold Cartesian product $S_1 \times S_2 \times \dots \times S_n$ is the set
of all possible $n$-tuples for which the first element is drawn from $S_1$, the second
is drawn from $S_2$, and so on:

$S_1 \times S_2 \times \dots \times S_n = \{(s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n)~\lvert~s_1 \in S_1, s_2 \in S_2, \dots, s_n \in S_n\}$
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>When <span class="arithmatex">\(n=2\)</span>, we simply speak of the <em>Cartesian product of two sets</em>.</p>
<h2 id="powerset">Powerset</h2>
<p>The powerset construction allows us to collect
all subgroups of a given set <span class="arithmatex">\(S\)</span>:</p>
<p>(def-pset)=
```{admonition} Definition (Powerset)
Given a set <span class="arithmatex">\(S\)</span>, the powerset <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathcal{P}(S)\)</span> is
the set consisting of all subsets of <span class="arithmatex">\(S\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(\mathcal{P}(S) = \{ A \lvert A \subseteq S \}\)</span>\)</span>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>For example $\mathcal{P}(\{1,2\}) = \{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1,2\}\}$.

For *finite* sets, the cardinality of their powerset is given by the following lemma.

(thm-powercard)=
```{admonition} Lemma (Cardinality of Powerset)
Given a finite set $S$, the
powerset $\mathcal{P}(S)$ has cardinality:

$$\lvert \mathcal{P}(S) \rvert = 2^{\lvert S \rvert}$$
